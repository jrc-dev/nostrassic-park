## Why ?

In the world of entertainment, reviews can be a battleground for differing opinions and cultural narratives. It's not uncommon to encounter instances where movies and series become embroiled in what's often referred to as the "cultural war," where diverse perspectives clash.

**Corporate interests** often play a significant role in shaping the perception of movies and series. Some companies may attempt to influence reviews to promote their content or downplay negative feedback. Understanding these dynamics can help users make informed choices.

Ex: [Is ‚ÄòThe Rings of Power‚Äô Getting Review Bombed? Amazon Suspends Ratings](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-amazon-review-bombed-1235211190/)

**Critics and reviewers** also carry significant weight in shaping public opinion. While many critics offer thoughtful, unbiased analysis, some may have **ideological or biased motivations** that influence their reviews. It's essential to approach reviews with a critical eye and consider multiple viewpoints.
